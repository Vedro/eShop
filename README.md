The client want a page called “users_list.php” in the /admin/ folder. He wants to be able to manage users, change the privilege and all the others informations (Update).
Only the Administrator should have access to this page.

If we choose to delete the user, we need a modal to be opened asking if we are sure about our choice (choice ‘cancel’ or ‘validate’).

Implement the same system for the “product_list.php”

Allow the user to change his/her personal informations, even the password (update)
